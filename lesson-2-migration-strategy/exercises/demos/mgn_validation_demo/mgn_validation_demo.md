# Demo: Application Validation for AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)

## Introduction

This demo will guide you through the process of validating applications migrated using AWS Application Migration Service (MGN). We'll cover setting up test instances, performing functional testing, and ensuring application performance post-migration.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with MGN configured
- Source servers replicated to AWS
- MGN replication jobs completed

## Step 1: Launch Test Instances

1. Open the AWS MGN console
2. Go to the "Source servers" page
3. Select the server(s) you want to test
4. Click "Test and cutover" > "Launch test instances"
5. Configure test instance settings:
   - Instance type
   - Network settings
   - Security groups
6. Launch the test instances

## Step 2: Access Test Instances

1. Wait for the test instances to be ready (Status: "Ready for testing")
2. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager or SSH to access the instances
3. Verify basic system functionality:
   - Check system logs
   - Ensure all expected services are running

## Step 3: Perform Functional Testing

1. Create a test plan covering key application functionalities
2. Test critical user workflows:
   - Login/logout
   - Data entry and retrieval
   - Report generation
   - Integration with other systems
3. Verify data integrity:
   - Compare sample data between source and migrated systems
   - Run database consistency checks

## Step 4: Performance Testing

1. Use load testing tools appropriate for your application
2. Simulate expected user load:
   - Normal operating conditions
   - Peak load scenarios
3. Monitor and record:
   - Response times
   - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
   - Error rates

## Step 5: Security Validation

1. Review security group configurations
2. Verify encryption settings for data at rest and in transit
3. Test user authentication and authorization
4. Perform vulnerability scans if applicable

## Step 6: Compliance Checks

1. Ensure migrated applications meet relevant compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
2. Verify data residency requirements are met
3. Check audit logging capabilities

## Step 7: Analyze Test Results

1. Compare test results with baseline performance metrics
2. Identify any functional issues or performance bottlenecks
3. Document all findings and discrepancies

## Step 8: Optimize and Retest

1. Address any issues found during testing:
   - Adjust instance types or resources if needed
   - Fix any application-specific problems
2. Re-run tests to verify improvements

## Step 9: Prepare for Cutover

1. If all tests pass satisfactorily, plan for the final cutover
2. Create a detailed cutover plan including:
   - Downtime window
   - Data synchronization steps
   - DNS and networking changes
   - Rollback procedures

## Conclusion

By following this validation process, you can ensure that applications migrated using AWS MGN function correctly, perform well, and meet all necessary security and compliance requirements in their new AWS environment.

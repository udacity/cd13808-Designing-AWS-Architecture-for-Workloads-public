# Instructions: Using AWS DataSync for Data Migration

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with access to AWS DataSync and S3.
- AWS CLI installed and configured on your local machine.
- Access to the on-premises storage system.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up AWS DataSync

1. **Create a DataSync Agent:**
   - Download and deploy the DataSync agent on your on-premises environment.
   - Register the agent with your AWS account using the AWS Management Console.

2. **Configure the Source Location:**
   - In the DataSync Console, create a source location pointing to your on-premises storage path (`/data/nyc_taxi_trip_duration`).

3. **Configure the Destination Location:**
   - Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the dataset.
   - In the DataSync Console, create a destination location pointing to the S3 bucket.

### Step 2: Create and Execute a DataSync Task

1. **Create a DataSync Task:**
   - In the DataSync Console, create a new task linking the source and destination locations.
   - Configure task settings, including filters and transfer options.

2. **Execute the DataSync Task:**
   - Start the task and monitor progress in the DataSync Console.
   - Ensure the dataset is transferred to the S3 bucket successfully.

### Step 3: Set Up Real-Time Data Synchronization

1. **Enable Incremental Transfers:**
   - Configure the DataSync task to perform incremental transfers for real-time synchronization.

2. **Schedule Regular Syncs:**
   - Use AWS CloudWatch Events or AWS Lambda to trigger the DataSync task at regular intervals.

### Step 4: Validate Data Transfer

1. **Verify Data in S3:**
   - Check the S3 bucket to ensure all files are transferred correctly.

2. **Discuss Strategies:**
   - Consider strategies for handling large-scale data migration, such as using AWS Snowball for initial bulk transfer or optimizing DataSync task configurations.

## Conclusion

By following these instructions, you will successfully transfer data using AWS DataSync, set up real-time synchronization, and validate the data transfer.

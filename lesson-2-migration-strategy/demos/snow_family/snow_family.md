# Using AWS Snow Family Services

## Introduction

AWS Snow Family provides physical devices to help you migrate large amounts of data into and out of AWS. This guide will walk you through the process of using Snow Family services.

## Step 1: Determine Your Needs

1. Assess your data volume:
   - Snowcone: Up to 14 TB
   - Snowball Edge: Up to 210 TB

2. Consider your environment:
   - Limited connectivity
   - Extreme conditions
   - Space constraints

## Step 2: Order Your Device

1. Log into the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to AWS Snow Family
3. Click "Create Job"
4. Select your device type
5. Provide job details (shipping info, security settings)
6. Review and create your job

## Step 3: Receive and Set Up the Device

1. Device arrives at your location
2. Connect the device to power and network
3. Download and install AWS OpsHub
4. Use AWS OpsHub to unlock and configure the device

## Step 4: Transfer Data

### For data import:
1. Connect your source to the Snow device
2. Copy data to the device using file copy or AWS CLI
3. Verify data integrity

### For edge computing:
1. Deploy EC2 instances or containers on the device
2. Run your applications and process data locally

## Step 5: Return the Device

1. Power off the device
2. Apply the pre-paid shipping label
3. Ship the device back to AWS

## Step 6: Track and Complete the Job

1. Monitor job status in the AWS Console
2. Once AWS receives the device, data will be uploaded to your specified S3 bucket
3. Verify data in your AWS account
4. AWS will securely erase the Snow device

## Best Practices

- Use multiple devices in parallel for large datasets
- Leverage AWS DataSync for ongoing transfers after initial migration
- Implement proper security measures (encryption, access controls)
- Test your workflow with a small dataset before full migration

## Conclusion

AWS Snow Family services provide a secure and efficient way to migrate large datasets and perform edge computing. By following these steps, you can successfully leverage these services for your data transfer and processing needs.

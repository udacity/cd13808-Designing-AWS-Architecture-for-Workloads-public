# Exemplar Solution: Evaluating On-Premises Kubernetes Cluster for AWS Migration

## 1. Well-Architected Framework Analysis

### Operational Excellence:
- Current: Kubernetes provides good operational practices, but managing physical infrastructure adds complexity.
- AWS: EKS can improve operational excellence by managing the Kubernetes control plane and simplifying node management.

### Security:
- Current: VPN provides secure access, but physical security is a concern.
- AWS: EKS integrates with AWS IAM and provides network isolation through VPCs, improving overall security posture.

### Reliability:
- Current: Kubernetes offers good reliability, but hardware failures could impact availability.
- AWS: EKS with multi-AZ deployment can enhance reliability and provide better disaster recovery options.

### Performance Efficiency:
- Current: Mix of optimized machines provides good performance, but hardware upgrades are challenging.
- AWS: EKS allows for easy scaling and use of various EC2 instance types to match workload requirements.

### Cost Optimization:
- Current: High upfront costs and potential over-provisioning.
- AWS: Pay-for-use model and ability to use Spot Instances can significantly optimize costs.

### Sustainability:
- Current: Limited control over hardware efficiency and power usage.
- AWS: Benefit from AWS's commitment to sustainability and more efficient resource utilization.

## 2. Recommended Migration Strategy

The recommended migration strategy is **Replatform** (also known as "lift, tinker, and shift"). This strategy allows for:
- Maintaining the existing Kubernetes architecture
- Taking advantage of cloud-native features
- Minimizing application changes while optimizing for the cloud

This architecture leverages AWS managed services to reduce operational overhead, improve scalability, and enhance security, while maintaining the familiar Kubernetes environment for your applications.

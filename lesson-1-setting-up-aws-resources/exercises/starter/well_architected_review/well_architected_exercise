# Exercise: Evaluating On-Premises Kubernetes Cluster for AWS Migration

## Scenario

Your company has decided to migrate its on-premises Kubernetes cluster to AWS. As a cloud architect, you've been tasked with evaluating the current infrastructure and recommending an appropriate migration strategy and target reference architecture.

## Current On-Premises Infrastructure

### Networking:
- Bare Metal Load balancer for incoming traffic
- Cisco VPN for secure remote access

### Compute:
- 20 physical servers running as Kubernetes nodes
- Auto-scaling managed through Kubernetes

### Storage:
- Network-attached storage (NAS) for persistent volumes

### Database:
- PostgreSQL cluster for application data

## Task

1. Evaluate the current infrastructure using the six pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework:
   - Operational Excellence
   - Security
   - Reliability
   - Performance Efficiency
   - Cost Optimization
   - Sustainability

2. Based on your evaluation, determine the most appropriate migration strategy.

## Deliverables

1. A brief analysis of the current infrastructure based on the Well-Architected Framework.
2. Recommended migration strategy with justification.

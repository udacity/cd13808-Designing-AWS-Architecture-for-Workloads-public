# Demo: Using AWS Well-Architected Tool for Pre-Migration Evaluation

## Introduction

In this demo, we'll walk through the process of using the AWS Well-Architected Tool to evaluate an on-premises workload before migrating it to the cloud. This tool helps ensure that your architecture aligns with best practices across various pillars.

## Step 1: Access the AWS Well-Architected Tool

1. Log into the AWS Management Console.
2. Search for "Well-Architected" in the services search bar.
3. Click on "AWS Well-Architected Tool."

## Step 2: Create a Workload

1. Click "Define workload."
2. Enter a name for your workload (e.g., "On-Prem-App-Migration").
3. Provide a description of your workload.
4. Select industry type and environment (e.g., "Pre-production").

## Step 3: Start the Review

1. Click "Start review."
2. You will see questions related to the six pillars of the Well-Architected Framework:
   - Operational Excellence
   - Security
   - Reliability
   - Performance Efficiency
   - Cost Optimization
   - Sustainability

## Step 4: Answer Questions

1. For each pillar, answer the questions based on your current on-premises setup.
2. Use the "Notes" section to document your current state and improvement ideas.
3. Donâ€™t worry if you answer "No" to many questions; this is about identifying areas for improvement.

## Step 5: Review the Results

1. After completing the questions, navigate to the "Improvement plan" tab.
2. Review any high-risk issues (HRIs) identified.
3. Examine medium-risk issues (MRIs) as well.

## Step 6: Develop an Improvement Plan

1. Based on your inspection results, create an improvement plan.
2. Prioritize critical issues and plan how to address them during migration.
3. Identify which AWS services can help solve specific issues.

## Step 7: Document and Share Findings

1. Use the "Generate report" feature to create a PDF of your findings.
2. Share this report with stakeholders and your migration team.
3. Use these results to inform your migration strategy and timeline.

## Conclusion

By using the AWS Well-Architected Tool, we've conducted a thorough evaluation of our workload and created a solid improvement plan. This preparation is crucial for ensuring a successful migration to AWS, allowing us to optimize our architecture for performance, security, and cost-efficiency.

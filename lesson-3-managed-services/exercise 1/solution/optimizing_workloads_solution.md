# Solution: Assessing and Optimizing Workloads

## Identified Bottlenecks

1. **Web Tier:**
   - **Instance Type:** The use of t2.micro instances may be insufficient for handling peak traffic, leading to CPU throttling and slow response times.
   - **Auto Scaling Configuration:** The current scaling policy may not respond quickly enough to traffic spikes.

2. **Database Tier:**
   - **Single RDS Instance:** A single db.t2.micro instance can become a bottleneck, especially without read replicas to distribute the load.

3. **Cost Efficiency:**
   - **Underutilized Resources:** Instances may be running at low utilization during off-peak hours, leading to unnecessary costs.

## Recommended Optimizations

1. **Web Tier:**
   - **Resize Instances:** Upgrade EC2 instances to t3.medium or t3.large to provide more CPU and memory resources.
   - **Optimize Auto Scaling:** Adjust the scaling policy to trigger faster scaling actions based on CPU utilization or request count metrics.

2. **Database Tier:**
   - **Add Read Replicas:** Implement read replicas for the RDS instance to distribute read traffic and reduce the load on the primary database.
   - **Consider Aurora:** Evaluate Amazon Aurora for its scalability and performance benefits over standard RDS MySQL.

3. **Cost Efficiency:**
   - **Use Spot Instances:** Consider using Spot Instances for non-critical workloads to reduce costs.
   - **Implement S3 Lifecycle Policies:** Use lifecycle policies to transition infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage classes.

## Justification

- **Resizing Instances:** Larger instance types provide more resources, reducing the risk of throttling and improving response times during peak loads.
- **Optimizing Auto Scaling:** Faster scaling ensures that the application can handle traffic spikes without degradation in performance.
- **Adding Read Replicas:** Distributing read traffic improves database performance and allows for more efficient scaling.
- **Using Spot Instances:** Spot Instances offer significant cost savings, especially for workloads that can tolerate interruptions.
- **Implementing Lifecycle Policies:** Transitioning data to cheaper storage classes optimizes storage costs without impacting performance.

## Conclusion

By implementing these optimizations, the architecture will achieve improved performance, scalability, and cost efficiency. These changes ensure that the application can handle peak loads effectively while minimizing operational costs.
